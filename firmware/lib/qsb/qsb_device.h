/**
 * @brief Initializes USB device.
 *
 * This function assumes that the USB clock has already been configured
 * for USB operation (usually for 48MHz).
 *
 * To place `strings` entirely into Flash/read-only memory, use
 * `static const * const strings[] = { ... };`
 * (note the double `const`).  The first `const` refers to the strings
 * while the second `const` refers to the array.
 * 
 * If `QSB_STR_UTF8` is not defined, the strings in the `strings` array have to be
 * encoded in Latin-1 (aka ISO-8859-1). If `QSB_STR_UTF8` is defined, UTF-8 encoding
 * is assumed. Note that USB 2.0 refers to Unicode version 4.0 (in an ECN) and
 * USB 3.2 refers to Unicode version 5.0 while the latest Unicode is version 14.0.
 * So the latest Unicode characters such as emojis might work but are not officially
 * supported by the standard.
 *
 * @param port USB port
 * @param device_desc USB device descriptor. This must not be changed while the device is in use.
 * @param config_descs Array of USB configuration descriptors. These must not be changed while the device is in use. The
 * length of this array is determined by the `bNumConfigurations` field in the device descriptor.
 * @param strings Array of strings for USB string descriptors. The device, configuration and interface descriptors refer
 * to these strings, e.g. in `iManufacturer`. Strings indexes are offset by 1: index 1 refers to `strings[0]`.
 * @param num_strings Number of items in `strings` array.
 * @param control_buffer Array that will hold the data received during control requests with DATA stage. The array must
 * be suffuciently large to hold the longest configuration descriptor and the longest in-bound control message.
 * @param control_buffer_size Size of `control_buffer`
 * @return the USB device initialized for use
