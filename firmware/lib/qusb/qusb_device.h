 * `static const * const strings[] = { ... };`
 * (note the double `const`).  The first `const` refers to the strings
 * while the second `const` refers to the array.
 *
 * @param port USB port
 * @param device_desc USB device descriptor. This must not be changed while the device is in use.
 * @param config_descs Array of USB configuration descriptors. These must not be changed while the device is in use. The
 * length of this array is determined by the `bNumConfigurations` field in the device descriptor.
 * @param strings Array of strings for USB string descriptors. The device, configuration and interface descriptors refer
 * to these string, e.g. in `iManufacturer`. Strings indexes are offset by 1: index 1 refers to strings[0].
 * @param num_strings Number of items in `strings` array.
 * @param control_buffer Array that will hold the data received during control requests with DATA stage
 * @param control_buffer_size Size of `control_buffer`
